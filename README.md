# Introduction

This repository contains a set of benchmarks for Linux and OS X. Each benchmark
compares several methods for accomplishing a given IO operation. These
benchmarks are intended to determine the fastest way to perform the following IO
operations on each target platform:

  - Sequentially reading a file.
  - Sequentially overwriting a preallocated file.
  - Replacing the contents of an existing file with those of another file.
